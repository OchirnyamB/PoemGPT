In order to run the python notebook. You have to download the curated dataset from 

[https://huggingface.co/datasets/brunokreiner/genius-lyrics/viewer?views%5B%5D=train](https://huggingface.co/datasets/brunokreiner/genius-lyrics/blob/main/english_lyrics_some_with_genres.csv)

2. I have included sample runs in the python notebook.
